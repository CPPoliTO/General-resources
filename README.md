# Beginners-resources

If you don't know what competitive programming is about, we recommend checking out the following links:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming#:~:text=Competitive%20programming%20(also%20known%20as,referred%20to%20as%20sport%20programmers.
- https://usaco.guide/general/intro-cp?lang=cpp.

For beginners, we highly recommend reading the first few chapters (at least 4) of the Competitive Programmer's Handbook, a free pdf available in the "Beginners material" folder in this repository.

Also, check out our presentation titled "Introduction to competitive programming" in the material, "Beginners material" folder in this repository.

Other beginners related resources will be uploaded in the same folder.

# General-resources-for-everyone

We recommend everyone to take part in our training contests, which will be held at least once a month in our Codeforces group with two separate contests, one for beginners and the other for everyone else, with the usual duration of two weeks.

It is obviously mandatory to take part in some competitive programming contests to improve as a competitor. The ones we recommend for beginners are:
- Atcoder beginner contests (the first problems are very easy, but the later ones can be very hard);
- Codeforces division 3 and 4 rounds;
- Codechef starters
- Leetcode biweekly contests.

All of the above are online contests specifically made to be accessible for absolute beginners. Other major contests are:
- Atcoder Regular Contests (recommended for people with Codeforces rating >= 1400);
- Atcoder Grand contests (recommended for people with Codeforces rating >= 1900);
- Codeforces division 1 + 2 rounds (recommended for everybody, but they can be tough to approach for absolute beginners);
- Codechef Cook-off and lunch-time (recommended for everybody).

If you need a tutorial for a specific algorithm/data structure/technique, we recommend the following sites:
- Codeforces blogs and/or catalog section, which is just a curated collection of blogs from their platform;
- https://cp-algorithms.com/;
- The competitive programmer's handbook;
- usaco.guide;
- Youtube channels such as Errichto and many others.
